#Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise needed help in finding out if her play "Fever" was going to have enough funding.

### Purpose
With all of the data she was able to gather from her Kickstarter campaign, I was able to tell her whether or not she was able to put her play together.

## Analysis and Challenges
I found the process of using Excel to find the data required to answer the clients quiestions, at times, to be quite difficult. Having never properly used Excel in the past. Learning and implementing the functions, albeit very useful in automating a lot of tasks, quite confusing to get it to work. Through trial and error I was able to complete this task. In completing the challenge the first step was to clean and analyze the data to ensure it was all in the correct formatting and style.
